					<h4>In the cooking department, I’m a food enthusiast</h4>
					<p>We started this blog in 2011 and have since been featured in Food & Wine, Food 52, Refinery29, SELF Magazine, and Oprah Magazine(!), among others. Love & Lemons was named Readers Choice Best Cooking Blog by Saveur Magazine in 2014 and won an Editor’s Choice award in 2016.  Also – our book is out! The New York Times described the book as “happiness in itself tossed in every bowl.” Bon Appétit said it was “One of the loveliest cookbooks we’ve ever seen.” Read more about The Love & Lemons Cookbook, here.</p>
